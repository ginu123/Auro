# Auro

Nowadays we have to scroll and search hard and need to go through different applications to get what we actually want.  Our proposed system is a solution to this problem.  The project is to build a personal digital assistant which is able to accept queries in the form of text (English) and respond back.  This application can be used to get or fetch the user required process based on the input provided.

This is an Upcoming Project
